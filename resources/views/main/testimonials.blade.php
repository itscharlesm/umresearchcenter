                     An alumnus of Central Mindanao Colleges, a prestigious school in Kidapawan City. Glancing back
                     to the year I was still a college student, CMC made it possible for me to pursue teaching by
                     giving me a scholarship and fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher. Imparting not just the
                     knowledge and abilities needed in practical settings, but also the positive outlook that a
                     CMCian needs to have when handling various challenges. To be honest, CMC has been such a huge
                     help and a major factor in all my accomplishments.
